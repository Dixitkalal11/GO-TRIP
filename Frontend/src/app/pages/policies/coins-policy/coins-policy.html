        <h2>11. Examples</h2>
        <h3>Example 1: Earning Coins (First Booking)</h3>
        <p>You book a bus ticket for ₹1,000:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coins earned: 2% of ₹1,000 = 20 coins</li>
          <li>Maximum coins you can use on next booking: 5 coins (₹5 discount)</li>
          <li>Your coin balance increases by 20 coins</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example 2: Using Coins (Second Booking)</h3>
        <p>You have 20 coins and book a train ticket for ₹2,000:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maximum coins allowed: 10 coins (2nd booking limit)</li>
          <li>You use 10 coins = ₹10 discount</li>
          <li>Amount to pay: ₹2,000 - ₹10 = ₹1,990</li>
          <li>Coins earned on this booking: 2% of ₹1,990 = 39.8 coins (rounded to 40 coins)</li>
          <li>Net coin change: 40 earned - 10 used = +30 coins</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Maximum coins allowed: 15 + (5-2) × 3 = 24 coins</li>
          <li>You use 20 coins = ₹20 discount</li>
